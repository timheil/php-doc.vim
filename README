This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2587

originally the 2005 PDV phpDocumentor for VIM tool (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1355)
than it was fixed by Kevin Olson (https://github.com/justinrainbow/php-doc.vim):
- fixed bugs w/ parameters not finding booleans
- added folding marker comment functionality

and finally I decicded to remove vim folding markers and clean the code a bit.
